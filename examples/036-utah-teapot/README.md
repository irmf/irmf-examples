# 036-utah-teapot

The Utah Teapot has an [amazing history](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/teapot/).

I downloaded "teapot3.scl" and "teapot-bezier.scl" from the [Alpha_1 Model Repository](
https://www-old.cs.utah.edu/gdc/projects/alpha1/help/man/html/model_repo/model_teapot/model_teapot.html)
and then converted it to IRMF using Google's "gemini-3-flash-preview" model
within the [Google Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/).

Here is the solid version of the Utah Teapot ("teapot3.scl") written in IRMF:

* Try loading [utah-teapot-wgsl.irmf](https://gmlewis.github.io/irmf-editor/?s=github.com/gmlewis/rust-irmf-slicer/blob/master/examples/036-utah-teapot/utah-teapot-wgsl.irmf) now in the experimental IRMF editor!
