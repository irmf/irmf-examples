# 035-the-thinker

The mascott for the amazing Berkeley Computed Axial Lithography (CAL)
Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (VAM) 3D printer project is
Rodin's "The Thinker".

Here is their mascott converted to IRMF using the commands from
https://github.com/gmlewis/rust-irmf-slicer :

```bash
$ stl-to-irmf -o the-thinker-uncompressed.irmf the-thinker.stl
$ compress-irmf --base64 -o the-thinker.irmf the-thinker-uncompressed.irmf
```

## the-thinker.irmf
